# React Smell Analyzer

React Smell Analyzer is a command-line tool for detecting selected software supply chain smells in React/npm projects.

The current prototype combines:

- native local analysis of project files;
- dependency usage analysis through external tooling;
- selected repository-level checks through Dirty-Waters running via WSL.

The tool generates structured reports with findings and errors for each analysis run.

## Current Scope

The current prototype targets projects in the npm ecosystem and analyzes information derived from:

- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- locally installed dependencies in `node_modules` (for selected smells)
- source code usage analysis through external tooling
- repository-level metadata through Dirty-Waters

The prototype is focused on lightweight, developer-oriented analysis and reporting.

It does **not**:

- execute dependency code during analysis;
- confirm malicious intent;
- prove exploitability;
- fully replace specialized ecosystem tools.

Instead, it highlights dependency-related smells and risk indicators that may deserve manual inspection.

## Currently Supported Smells

### Native local smells

These smells are detected directly by the tool through local parsing and rule-based analysis:

- `no-package-lock`
- `pinned-dependency`
- `url-dependency`
- `restrictive-constraint`
- `permissive-constraint`
- `duplicate-versions`
- `installation-scripts`
- `unmaintained-package`

### Knip-based smells

These smells are detected through integration with [Knip](https://knip.dev/):

- `unused-dependency`
- `missing-dependency`

### Dirty-Waters-based smells

These smells are detected through integration with [Dirty-Waters](https://github.com/chains-project/dirty-waters/) executed through **WSL/Ubuntu**:

- `deprecated-dependency`
- `no-source-code-link`
- `no-source-code-sha`
- `depends-on-fork`
- `no-build-attestation`
- `no-invalid-code-signature`
- `aliased-packages`

> **Note:** Dirty-Waters-based smells are external, slower, GitHub-dependent, and WSL/Ubuntu-oriented in the tested environment. They must be executed explicitly and are not part of the default `--all` run.

## Analysis Modes

The tool currently supports three main execution modes:

### 1. Default full analysis

Runs all default local and Knip-based smells:

```bash
react-smell-analyzer --project "C:\path\to\react-project" --all

### 2. Dirty-Waters full analysis

Runs all Dirty-Waters based smells:

```bash
react-smell-analyzer --project "C:\path\to\react-project" --repo owner/repo --dirty-waters-backend wsl --wsl-distro Ubuntu --dirty-waters-root /home/<your-user>/dirty-waters --dirty-waters-all

### 3. Specific smell analysis

Runs one or more explicitly selected smells:

```bash
react-smell-analyzer --project "C:\path\to\react-project" --smell duplicate-versions

Example with a Dirty-Waters smell:

```bash
react-smell-analyzer --project "C:\path\to\react-project" --repo owner/repo --dirty-waters-backend wsl --wsl-distro Ubuntu --dirty-waters-root /home/<your-user>/dirty-waters --smell deprecated-dependency


### Important Notes About Selected Smells

installation-scripts

This smell requires node_modules to be installed locally, because it inspects dependency package.json files inside the installed dependency tree.

unmaintained-package

This smell is heuristic-based. In the current prototype, it uses npm registry metadata and flags packages whose last registry modification is older than a defined threshold.

A flagged package is not necessarily abandoned, but it may deserve manual inspection.

## Requirements

### Core requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- npm-based project to analyze

### Additional requirements for Knip-based smells

For `unused-dependency` and `missing-dependency`, the target project must be able to run Knip.  
In practice, this usually means that the analyzed project should have Knip available locally or be able to execute it through `npx`.

For example, inside the target project:

```bash
npm install -D knip typescript @types/node


# Dirty-Waters Integration (WSL/Ubuntu)

The `react-smell-analyzer` supports a subset of smells through the external tool [Dirty-Waters](https://github.com/chains-project/dirty-waters/).

## Important Notes

Dirty-Waters-based smells are different from the local smells implemented directly in this project:

- they are slower to execute;
- they require a **GitHub repository** (`owner/repo`);
- they require a **GitHub API token**;
- in the tested environment, they were only validated successfully through **WSL/Ubuntu**.

Because of these requirements, Dirty-Waters-based smells are **not included in the default `--all` workflow** and should be executed explicitly.

> **Note:** Dirty-Waters-based smells are external, slower, GitHub-dependent, and WSL/Ubuntu-oriented in the tested environment. They must be executed explicitly and are not part of the default `--all` run.

## Requirements

To use Dirty-Waters-based smells, you need:

- Windows with **WSL** installed
- An **Ubuntu** distribution inside WSL
- A local clone of `dirty-waters` inside Ubuntu
- A valid **GitHub Personal Access Token**
- A project hosted on **GitHub**

---

## 1. Install WSL

Open **PowerShell as Administrator** and run:

```powershell
wsl --install -d Ubuntu

Restart the computer if requested.

After restarting, open Ubuntu and complete the initial setup by creating:

- a Linux username
- a Linux password

## 2. Prepara Ubuntu

Inside Ubuntu, install the required tools:

```ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-venv python3-pip git nodejs npm curl

## 3. Create a GitHub token

Create a fine-grained personal access token in GitHub with:

- Resource owner: your GitHub account
- Repository access: Only select repositories
- select the repository you want to analyze
- Repository permissions:
- Metadata -> Read-only
- Contents -> Read-only

This token is required by Dirty-Waters to access repository metadata.

## 4. Configure the GitHub token

### In Windows (required when running react-smell-analyzer from CMD/PowerShell)

In the same terminal where you run the analyzer:

```bash
set GITHUB_API_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

To make it persistent for future terminals:

```bash
setx GITHUB_API_TOKEN "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"

### In Ubuntu/WSL (recommended for standalone Dirty-Waters usage)

```ubuntu
export GITHUB_API_TOKEN='YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'

To make it persistent:

```ubuntu
echo 'export GITHUB_API_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

## 5. Clone and install Dirty-Waters inside Ubuntu

Inside Ubuntu:

```ubuntu
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/chains-project/dirty-waters.git
cd dirty-waters
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e .

At this point, Dirty-Waters should be available inside WSL.

## 6. Standalone Dirty-Waters execution

To validate that Dirty-Waters works correctly in Ubuntu:

```ubuntu
cd ~/dirty-waters/tool
python main.py -p OWNER/REPOSITORY -pm npm --gradual-report false --check-deprecated --debug

Example:

```ubuntu
cd ~/dirty-waters/tool
python main.py -p Parafita123/DSSMV_ProjectReact_1231283_1231051 -pm npm --gradual-report false --check-deprecated --debug

Another example for source-code repository checks:

```ubuntu
python main.py -p Parafita123/DSSMV_ProjectReact_1231283_1231051 -pm npm --gradual-report false --check-source-code --debug

## 7. Running Dirty-Waters-based smells from react-smell-analyzer

Dirty-Waters-based smells must be executed explicitly.

Example:

```bash
react-smell-analyzer --project "C:\Users\fpara\Desktop\DSSMV_ProjectReact_1231283_1231051-master" --repo Parafita123/DSSMV_ProjectReact_1231283_1231051 --dirty-waters-backend wsl --wsl-distro Ubuntu --dirty-waters-root /home/parafita/dirty-waters --smell deprecated-dependency

Another example:

```bash
react-smell-analyzer --project "C:\Users\fpara\Desktop\DSSMV_ProjectReact_1231283_1231051-master" --repo Parafita123/DSSMV_ProjectReact_1231283_1231051 --dirty-waters-backend wsl --wsl-distro Ubuntu --dirty-waters-root /home/parafita/dirty-waters --smell no-source-code-link

## 8. Report location

Dirty-Waters generates its own Markdown report inside the WSL environment.

A typical output path is:

/home/<your-user>/dirty-waters/tool/results/results_<timestamp>/<commit>_static_summary.md

Example:

/home/parafita/dirty-waters/tool/results/results_2026-05-17-16-22-19/09802c669fb76b9c5209bd9a6cf797b68c5c6657_static_summary.md

This Markdown report is the primary output of Dirty-Waters and should be considered the source of truth for Dirty-Waters-based checks.

## 9. Current limitations

Dirty-Waters integration has the following limitations:

- it requires a GitHub repository and cannot analyze a purely local project without repository metadata;
- it is significantly slower than the local smells and Knip-based smells;
- in the tested setup, it was only validated successfully through WSL/Ubuntu;
- Dirty-Waters-based smells are therefore executed separately and are not part of the default fast analysis flow.

For this reason, the recommended workflow is:

use react-smell-analyzer normally for local/fast smells;
use Dirty-Waters-based smells only when repository-level supply-chain analysis is needed.
